# SpanLinq

Work In Progress

## Difference between `System.Linq.Enumerable`

### `Cast`

Needs 2 type params. `Cast<in, out>()`

### `Sum`

It returns `int`/`double`/etc. instead of `int?`/`double?`.

### `Concat`

~~Unlike `Linq Concat` which uses deferred execution, `second` is evaluated immediately.~~
